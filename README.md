# Audio-Filtering

This project invloves taking a single frequency tone and adding noise to it. The heart of the project is to design a filter that can remove the noise from the audio file and return the single frequency tone.

The filter implementes a Hann window to single out the desired frequency. All programming is done in MATLAB.
